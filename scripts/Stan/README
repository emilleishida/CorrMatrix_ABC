In order to run Stan without problems of compatibility with different versions of Python packages, 
first make sure you have conda installed:

download conda: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

install conda: https://conda.io/docs/install/full.html#install-instructions

In order to create the environment allowing you to run the scripts in this directory do, in the command line:
** in the line bellow, you can choose substitute 3.5 by 2.7 if you prefer working on Python 2 **

>>  conda create -n stan python=3.5 pystan scipy

say yes to subsequent steps. 

Once everything is installed, activate the environment, in the command line do:

>> source activate stan

your command line will now look something like this:

(stan) emille@clrlsstport02:

inside this environment there are all the correct versions of the packages needed to run pystan. 
If Stan is correctly installed, there should be no major problems. 

In order to test the installation, navigate to our repository ~/scripts/Stan/ and do, in the command line:

>> python test_Stan.py

after the calculation is finished you should have something like this on the screen:

Inference for Stan model: anon_model_e9f10baf834c1214e3f5640ab86ee950.
3 chains, each with iter=2500; warmup=1250; thin=1; 
post-warmup draws per chain=1250, total post-warmup draws=3750.

which is what we expected.. a~ 1 and b~ 0.
